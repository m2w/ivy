Ivy
===

Ivy is a static site generator (like jekyll) written in elixir.

THIS IS A PROTOTYPE. It will probably not work, it might break
things, it is untested. I recommend you have a look at the source
before playing with it.

It is currently a rough prototype, but aims to provide:

- template inheritance
- reusable template snippets ('includes')
- markdown content with meta-data
- simple configuration
- a local development server with live-recompilation files change
- speed (compared to jekyll)
